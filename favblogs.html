            <a href="#">Ecosophia - by John Michael Greer</a><br>
            <div class="tags"> #environment #futurism #economy </div><br>
            JMG (as he is known among his followers) writes about the depleting
            reserves of "accessible" natural resources, our future economy (or
            a lack of thereof), and a critique of our ways. Occasionally, one
            gets to read about his other passion â€“ spirituality.

            <a href="">Stephen Diehl's blog</a><br>
            <div class="tags"> #computers #cryptocurrency #programming</div><br>
            Diehl is a computer scientist and a programmer. He mainly (these
            days) writes rants against cryptocurrencies. Highly recommended if
            you have always smelled something fishy about
            cryptoponz...cryptocurrencies.

            Pretty standard engineering blog from Brave. Great if you'd like to
            know more about privacy on the web, what brave is doing towards
            that, and what others are not doing.
