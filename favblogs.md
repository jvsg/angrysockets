            <p>
                Here's a collection of blogs that I regularly read and
                recommend. They cover topics ranging from
                environmentalism to computer science.

                        JMG (as he is known among his followers) writes
                        about the depleting reserves of "accessible"
                        natural resources, our future economy (or a lack
                        of thereof), and a critique of our ways.
                        Occasionally, one gets to read about his other
                        passion â€“ spirituality.

                        Diehl is a computer scientist and a programmer.
                        He mainly (these days) writes rants against
                        cryptocurrencies. Highly recommended if you have
                        always smelled something fishy about
                        cryptoponz...cryptocurrencies.

                        Pretty standard engineering blog from Brave.
                        Great if you'd like to know more about privacy
                        on the web, what brave is doing towards that,
                        and what others are not doing.
